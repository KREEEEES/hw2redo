<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />



<br />
<p>Hello everyone, my name is Chris Barber and I am a senior BAIS major focusing on the Information Track. I was born and raised right up the road in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. I knew from a young age that I was meant to be a Hawkeye, and have enjoyed every minute at this school. From a young age I fell in love with technology and all of the amazing things that it can do to improve our lives. My goal after I graduate is to either go into private consulting to help business owners improve their systems, or go work for large commercial company to help improve their websites. My dream job would be to work at Nike and help implement new changes to improve on their already highly sophisticated online store.</p>
